4,Hi everyone. I have constant nausea 8 days after an iron infusion. I had other symptoms on day 3 but they went away.Has anyone else experienced this and should I just ride it through the next couple of weeks? I’m too scared to do it again after feeling so unwell and having to continue working it’s been a nightmare ,xdvgsrgvsdv
5,"Hi I had an iron infusion on 26 March this year and ended up in hospital a week later with severe abdominal pain nausea  diarrhoea and vomiting. Nearly 4 weeks on and still experiencing stomach pain and nausea from time to time. It’s been completely debilating for me and I’ve had 4 weeks off work as I couldn’t function, I was bedridden most of the time. I’m back at work next week and I too am scared to ever have another infusion again. ",xdfrdgv
6,"Hi Elizabeth, Sorry for my late response, I must have missed it.  I ended up getting a stomach infection after my iron infusion also. That's why it took so long for me to heal.  It was helicobacter pylori and it was hell. I was on antibiotics for 2 weeks to kill it off and finished them mid May. It took me up to early May to come back to work on reduced hours.  I am still feeling the effects of the stomach infection and not yet 100%.  My specialist said that iron is such a strong mineral, it ended up washing away my whole stomach flora enabling the bad bacteria to thrive.  Knowing what I know now, never again. I still have to manage my diet and avoid highly acidic foods, red meat being one of them but once my stomach inflammation heals I will increase my iron rich foods in my diet and have regular blood tests to monitor. I'm feeling very good now.",grdgvxdv
7,"Thanks for the response. I’m still not better. No diarrhea anymore, but the nausea comes in terrible wavesexhaustion  fever. I can barely work a few hours a day. I’m on day 22 since infusion. How did they test for H. Pylori? Did you feel better once you started it? ",vfrdfvg
